# kaggle-cats-dogs

Code for The [Kaggle Cats and Dogs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition) challenge using the 
[Cortex](https://github.com/thinktopic/cortex) project. In particular, heavily using the example from the [suite-classification](https://github.com/thinktopic/cortex/tree/master/examples/suite-classification)

A blog post covering it [http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2016/12/27/deep-learning-in-clojure-with-cortex/](http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2016/12/27/deep-learning-in-clojure-with-cortex/)

## Usage

Get the datasets from the above Kaggle Site. Download the `train.zip` and `test.zip` to the resources directory and unzip them.

This example has been recently updated to cortex's master version, so to run it you will need to clone the cortex project and run the local-install script.
